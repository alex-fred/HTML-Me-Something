  <h1 class="title capitalize">My Hobbies</h1>
  <h5>By: Alex Frederick</h5>
  <h6 class="publish-time">Published: 2 Days Ago</h6>

  <p>I have a lot of hobbies and interests that take up most of the space in my mind and my free time. I've always been into making and creating things out of nothing. I love things that are "vintage", durable, and made to last. I have an analog mindset. I'm a classic man. </p>

  <h2>Hockey</h2>
  <p>I've played hockey all my life. I grew up in Michigan, which is a hot bed for the sport. I had a wealth of opportunities and I got to play with so many talented and well-known people. I still play hockey to this day, but there it's a lot less competitive.</p>
    <h5>Teams I've Played For</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Lapeer Storm</li>
      <li>Michigan Mountain Cats</li>
      <li>Lapeer East Eagles</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Vinyl Collecting</h2>
  <p>Music has defined almost every moment in my life; I am always listening to it. When I get the chance to break away from the convenience of digital audio, I step into the world of lo-fi. I have a turntable and hundreds of records that I've been collecting for years. It's a relaxing medium for listening to your favorite songs. It promotes patience and opens the mind to music.</p>
    <h5>Favorite Albums</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Frightened Rabbit - Pedestrian Verse</li>

    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Art</h2>
  <p>I like to create art. I've had an eye for creativity since I was a kid. I'm always looking at things in a creative aspect. I have a tendency to be extremely calculated and carefully measured in the art that I create, as opposed to fre flowing and abstract.</p>
    <h5>Favorite Subjects/Medium</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Pencil</li>
      <li>Linoleum Carving/Block Printing</li>
      <li>Oil On Canvas</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Music</h2>
  <p>I play a few musical instruments as well. I started on the drums when I was a kid. When I was in high school I taught myself the guitar and the bass. I write and record my own music.</p>
    <h5>Instruments I Play/Medium</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Drums</li>
      <li>Guitar</li>
      <li>Mandolin</li>
      <li>Bass</li>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <p>&mdash;It's great to have a creative outlet for your ideas. I believe everyone should invest in discovering and pursuing their hobbies.</p>
